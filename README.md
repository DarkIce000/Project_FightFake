### Summary

---

1.  **Why this project?**

	Aim is simple stopping mindlessy and unintensionally spreading hate news or  sharing previously established news is Fake. This also prevent social engineered posts from taking over your emotions at that moment, and let you take one step back before sharing it to others.Psychologically we are driven to the momental hormonal changes that time but if there is something that can hint and make things obvious, because fake news hides in the plain sight. 
2. **What we have done to solve above problem?** 

	So to make the fake news obvious we have built a chrome extension, that highlights the previous established fake news in the red and search the internet for the sources that has reported about this news previously. If sources are trusted it will show near the post. Using Gemini to take process the article and take decision. 
3. **What we are expecting it to solve ?** 

	I am expecting it to making fake news obvious, so that it does not hides in the plain sight. If any person sharing that post has in the back of the mind, I am sharing the post that is fake news.
